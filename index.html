In this exersize we learned to name all of our websites "index.html" as well as the importance and role of a README.md file, which is supposed to include the names and contact information of the developers, project name and description, instructions on program installation, a link to its GitHub page, and copywrite information. It uses HTML only.

                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy going backpacking and am a photographer. The image seen here was taken at sunrise at the top of Maple Pass. I generally do astrophotography which you can see a small example of in the picture at the top of the page. I have dedicated dozens and dozens of hours to planning shoots, taking long exposures, and processing the images.</p>
